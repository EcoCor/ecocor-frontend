# What is EcoCor?

EcoCor, short for “ecocritical corpora”, is an open source collection of programmable corpora (for reading and) for research in computational literary studies as well as in digital environmental humanities. The corpora contained in EcoCor collect literary prose texts coded in (TEI based on [ELTeC Encoding Guidelines level 1]((https://distantreading.github.io/Schema/eltec-1.html))) that deal with, depict or reflect on nature or human-environment-relationships in a quantitatively or qualitatively remarkable way. For more information about our approach to building the corpora, see the [FAQs]([https://www.ecocor.org/doc/faq](https://www.ecocor.org/doc/faq)).

With EcoCor, we technically follow the concept of programmable corpora, which was first introduced with the “drama corpora platform” [DraCor]([https://dracor.org](https://dracor.org)). See also the 2023 report ["On Programmable Corpora"]([https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7664964](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7664964)) by Ingo Börner und Peer Trilcke.

A first prototype of EcoCor was developed by a team of researchers and designers (see [Credits]([https://www.ecocor.org/doc/credits](https://www.dracor.org/doc/credits))) during the [#EcoHack2023](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EcoHack2023?f=live) hackathon ["Environmental Data, Media and the Humanities"]([https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/digital-humanities/aktivitaeten/henriette-herz-hackathons/environmental-data-media-and-the-humanities-hackathon](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/digital-humanities/aktivitaeten/henriette-herz-hackathons/environmental-data-media-and-the-humanities-hackathon)) in May/June 2023 at the University of Potsdam. The development was supported by funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement [No. 101004984]([https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101004984](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101004984)).

We plan to successively expand EcoCor beyond the current prototype. If you would like to contribute to the project, please contact us at [digital-humanities@uni-potsdam.de](mailto:digital-humanities@uni-potsdam.de)
